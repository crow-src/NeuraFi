		"description": "NeuraFi is committed to becoming the world’s leading decentralized cross-chain and privacy finance hub, building a seamless, secure, and anonymous asset network for Web3 users. We offer one-stop cross-chain financial solutions, supporting one-click asset swaps across major public chains such as Ethereum, BNB Chain, and Solana. Additionally, we incorporate technologies like zero-knowledge proofs, coin mixing protocols, and stealth addresses to ensure that transaction history, fund flows, and identity information remain completely anonymous and untraceable.",
		"faq": {
			"v1": {
				"answer": "NeuraFi adopts a multi-layered, modular technical architecture, aggregating multiple cross-chain communication protocols (LayerZero, Axelar, Wormhole) to achieve cross-chain interoperability. Core features include:  \n1. Smart Routing Engine: Automatically selects the optimal cross-chain path to ensure transaction atomicity  \n2. Privacy Protection System: Integrates zero-knowledge proofs (ZK-SNARKs) and coin mixing protocols  \n3. Liquidity Aggregation: Combines Uniswap V3 concentrated liquidity and Curve stablecoin optimization  \n4. Security Protection: Multiple rounds of independent audits, formal verification, and time-lock mechanisms",
				"question": "Technical Architecture"
			},
			"v2": {
				"answer": "NeuraFi focuses on addressing two core pain points in the blockchain ecosystem:  \n1. Cross-chain swaps: Supporting seamless asset exchanges among major public chains such as Ethereum, BNB Chain, Solana, Polygon, Avalanche, and others  \n2. Privacy protection services: Achieving fully anonymous asset transfers through zero-knowledge proofs, coin mixing protocols, and stealth address technology  \n3. Liquidity mining: Users can provide liquidity to earn a share of trading fees and NeuraFi token rewards  \n4. Decentralized governance: NeuraFi token holders participate in platform governance decisions",
				"question": "Core Features"
			},
			"v3": {
				"answer": "NeuraFi’s privacy protection system employs multiple cryptographic technologies:  \n1. Zero-Knowledge Proofs: Users can deposit and withdraw without revealing their identities, proving asset ownership through ZK-SNARKs.  \n2. Coin Mixing Protocol: Assets enter a large-scale privacy pool and are mixed with other users’ funds, breaking the linkage of fund flows.  \n3. Stealth Addresses: A unique one-time address is generated for each payment, preventing address correlation analysis.  \n4. Multi-Hop Encrypted Routing: Inspired by Tor’s onion routing, it protects transaction metadata from being tracked.",
				"question": "Privacy Technology"
			},
			"v4": {
				"answer": "The core team of NeuraFi consists of senior experts in blockchain and cryptography:  \n• Founder: Former core researcher at the Ethereum Foundation, with 10+ years of experience in blockchain protocol development  \n• CTO: Former core developer at Uniswap, technical expert in the DeFi field  \n• CPO: PhD in cryptography, authority in zero-knowledge proofs, former researcher at the Zcash Foundation  \n• Advisory Team: Professors from Stanford and MIT, founders of leading Layer 1 projects, top partners from prominent crypto VCs",
